Whether I'm riding down a highway
Or walking down a street
It makes no difference, baby doll
Wherever we chance to meet


Each time I hold your little hand
It makes me feel so very nice

Whether we're standing on your doorstep
Or sitting in a park
Or strolling down a shady lane
Or dancing in the dark
Where I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes

conten to be saved
