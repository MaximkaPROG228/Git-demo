Whether I'm riding down a highway
Or walking down a street
It makes no difference, baby doll
Wherever we chance to meet

Each time I hold your little hand
It makes me feel so very nice

Whether I'm riding down a highway
Or walking down a street
It makes no difference, baby doll
Wherever we chance to meet

Each time I hold your little hand
It makes me feel so very nice
