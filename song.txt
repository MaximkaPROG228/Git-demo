Whether I'm riding down a highway
Or walking down a street
It makes no difference, baby doll
Wherever we chance to meet

Whether we're standing on your doorstep
Or sitting in a park
Or strolling down a shady lane
Or dancing in the dark
Where I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
